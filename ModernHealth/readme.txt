Modern Health needs a new template which will be based off of the request a meeting template (In Progress Event template): Adobe Marketo Engage with a bit more flexibility though.

I don't know if this is much to go off of but they sent across a rough sketch of what they'd like it to look like (attached below).


 Essentially, they want:
 - the header 
 - the title module, 
 - 5-6 togglable text modules, 
         - copy .content2 and remove bodyspkr, rename class nad togglabale

 - CTA buttons (wherever you'd see fit),
 - a module for a form 
 - and two images on the right side as well. 
  - and footer
 
 - All of which can be hidden without leaving any empty space on the page.
