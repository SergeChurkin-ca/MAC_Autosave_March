<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The COVID-19 pandemic has been disruptive and life-changing in many ways. But there is a silver lining in almost any situation, and many employers have embraced the positive changes that occurred because of the pandemic. <br /><br />In the workplace, the flexibility to pivot to different types of work environments, particularly remote and hybrid arrangements, is an outgrowth of the pandemic that is helping employers and workers alike.<br /><br />Ohio companies and businesses nationwide are seeing the benefits of this kind of flexibility when it comes to recruiting and retaining employees amid a severe labor shortage. Employees like the flexibility of working remotely, and the availability of remote scheduling has become a common question recruits ask in job interviews. <br /><br />In response to the growth of remote and hybrid work arrangements, Human Resources departments are finding the need for new policies and procedures to govern situations that were previously unknown in the office. <br /><br />Like, can you impose a dress code for someone who works at home? (The answer is: Yes, during video meetings.)</span></span>

<h3><span style="color: #0f004e;"><strong>Preference for Remote Work</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">With more than 4 million people having left the workforce during the pandemic, employers in nearly every industry are scrambling for recruits and finding new ways to retain talented workers.

        In the past, employers sometimes allowed certain employees to work remotely on an ad hoc basis, but these were often exceptions to the rule and did not defined policies and procedures were not necessary.<br /><br />Today, though, with requests
        for remote work arrangements common among existing workers and recruits, savvy HR departments are researching and adopting policies and best practices to address the trend. Most importantly, these policies and procedures bring consistency and
        transparency to the process, protecting companies from claims of favoritism among employees.<br /><br />Nationwide, companies are starting to see an increase in discrimination lawsuits from individuals who believe they were inappropriately denied
        remote work opportunities, so the risk is real. Well-written, transparent policies and procedures can provide protection.
