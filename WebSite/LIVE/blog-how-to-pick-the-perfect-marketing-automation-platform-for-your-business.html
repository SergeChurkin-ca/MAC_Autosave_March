	<div class="col-md-12" style="">
        <div class="blog">          
            <p>Few organizations have the resources to fully staff up for a
comprehensive marketing automation initiative, and even those that
do, frequently reach out to specialists for in-depth guidance. This blog
post is the first in a series that aims to help marketers set relevant
priorities, recruit expert guidance, and establish winning automation
campaigns. In a future post, I will cover the criteria that are necessary
to write a Request For Proposal (RFP) when making a vendor
selection.<br><br>
Naturally, a core component of any marketing automation initiative is
the selection of the marketing automation platform itself. This can be
a daunting challenge. Each of the platforms possess different
strengths, and reflect the dyed-in-the-wool assumptions that their
developers brought to the creative process. Naturally, it's
advantageous to discern these biases before selecting the platform.
Experience is the best teacher, and for that reason, it is useful to
connect with people who have worked directly with the solutions you
may be short-listing. User groups, for example, are a great place to
join in discussions and solicit unbiased opinions. Marketing
automation consultants can also serve as a valuable source of
information as they frequently have deep operational knowledge of
the leading platforms.

            <h2>A Quick Review of What Marketing Automation Actually is:</h2>
            <p><br>As a first step, I want to briefly define what marketing automation is,
and what it is not. Many people think that marketing automation has
to do with sending a lot of emails. Although that's certainly part of it,
automation takes things a step further by enabling an interpretation of
how those emails are responded to. In short, these platforms ask,
what did the recipients do with the emails? They add value by
providing a guidance system that allows for near real-time evaluation
of tactics, and can quickly put a lens on which selling propositions
proved of interest, and those that missed the mark. Systems can be
further configured to escalate the relevance messaging by monitoring, and responding to, prospect actions. It is the presence of
these feedback mechanisms that allow marketing automation to
deliver results that blow past standard mass-batch email tactics. This
is different from basic email campaigns, which deploy emails to
unsegmented audiences and lack interpretive capabilities. Although
there is nothing wrong with such methods, they do not tap into the full
equity that may be available in a prospect base.
<br><br></p>
			<div class="break"><img src="images/testdot.png" alt="divider"><hr></div>

            <h2>The Three Tenets of Marketing Automation</h2>
            <p><br>A marketing automation platform is defined by, and offers the
following three capabilities:<br><br>
1. The ability to segment and channel prospects according to areas
of interest<br>
2. A means of monitoring prospect inputs<br>
3. The capacity to analyze data and build for improved campaign
performance<br><br>
Combined, these three functions can effectively align your sales
department with the leads that are most likely to convert to
customers. As an added bonus, additional efficiencies can be
realized by shifting manual tasks to ones that are automated.
<br><br></p>

            <h2>Assessing Your Company's Readiness for a Marketing
Automation Program:</h2>
            <p><br>In general, anyone who delivers news through a digital channel can
make use of marketing automation. The prerequisites include; a
database of email addresses, a content strategy, and a platform to
facilitate deployment. As with most large-scale projects, it is best to
define the end goal first and work back from that point.
<br><br></p>
<div class="break"><img src="images/testdot.png" alt="divider"><hr></div>

            <h2>Setting Objectives:</h2>
            <p><br>Sometimes, it's easy to miss big things - such as the fundamental
reason for an initiative. Here it's important to establish consensus
across the board about what a marketing automation campaign is
intended to achieve. It's surprising how frequently simple questions can reveal significant misalignments.
<br><br></p>
<div class="break"><img src="images/testdot.png" alt="divider"><hr></div>

            <h2>Types of Goals Frequently Associated With Marketing
Automation Campaigns:</h2>
            <p><br>• Increase quarterly sales revenues<br>
• Establish impact of campaign initiatives by tracking Return On
Investment (ROI)<br>
• Increase database of potential customers<br>
• Build brand awareness<br>
• Establish ROI for Search Engine Marketing expenditures<br>
• Increase attendance for corporate events
<br><br></p>
			
			<div class="break"><img src="images/testdot.png" alt="divider"><hr></div>

            <h2>Measuring Results:</h2>
            <p><br>The type of goal will usually dictate what is being measured.
Depending on the objective, some success metrics are easier to
quantify than others. Brand awareness is notoriously difficult to
measure, whereas sales objectives are usually easier to benchmark.
It's also important to determine the point where you sample the data
- keep in mind that success can be claimed at any stage of the buyer
journey, starting with a conversion on a landing page right through to
an analysis of customer lifetime value. There are no right or wrong
answers here, it is just a matter of how you want to define it.

            <h2>Tell Me About Your Sales Department…</h2>
            <p><br>This is one of my favourite questions when meeting with a new client.
Although frequently overlooked by digital marketers, it&#39;s the first thing
that I want to hear about. As marvellous as it is, advanced marketing
technology counts for very little if it's out-of-step with the people who
close the deals and write the contracts.<br><br>
One of the key things that I try to get an idea about is how busy the
sales department is in relation to the amount of incoming sales leads
that are being generated. Although much is said about ROI, very little
is said about achieving an optimal balance between sales capacity and demand generated by marketing. Yet, this is where profitability
actually resides. When a system is in place that filters for the highest
quality leads and matches them to optimal sales capacity, healthy
revenues are bound to follow.<br><br>
A marketing automation program works best when it is attracting and
filtering enough prospects to keep sales representatives profitably
engaged. Traffic alone is not sufficient as a flood of low quality leads
can waste premium sales time and reflect badly on the marketing
department's ability to attract the right type of buyer. On the other
hand, setting the bar too high leaves the sales department under
utilized.

            <h2>Scoring to the Rescue</h2>
            <p><br>So how do we strike the right balance between sales activity, and
marketing generated demand? The answer, in terms of marketing
automation platforms, is provided by scoring. Most marketing
platforms have the ability to monitor a prospect's behaviour and
assign a score to represent aggregated activity. Such interactions
may include, email opens, clicks on links, file downloads and website
visits. Scoring thresholds can then be set, and tied, to triggers that
notify the sales department when prospects are especially active.<br><br>
When shopping for a marketing automation platform, it is essential to
choose one that can adequately meet your needs as far as scoring
evaluation is concerned. During this process, you will want to
consider the types of prospect activities that are predictive of buying
behaviour. This will help you develop a workable model when it
comes time to configure the platform. You may also want to consider
whether or not you will be dividing prospects according to product
lines. Some platforms allow marketers to establish separate scoring
silos along the lines of corporate divisions. This can also prove useful
when setting up rules to assign leads to sales representatives.

            <h2>How Grading Can Help Maximize Sales Resources</h2>
            <p><br>While scoring is a great way to gain insights into how motivated your
prospects are, grading is a means to turn the table and ask how
interested you are in them. Quality sales time is a hot commodity, so this represents your opportunity to stand guard over this valuable
resource. Grading, however, can come at a tradeoff in that it requires
a series of questions to be asked. Usually, these involve information
about a prospect's company, job title, annual sales and other
pertinent disclosures. People are naturally reluctant to share such
information at the beginning of a relationship, so asking these kinds
of questions can reduce form conversions and slow database
population over the long term. When setting up grading, a company
has to ask how much of a trade-off they are willing to make to gain a
rich profile of their sales leads. Once again, it is important not to be
assumptive here. A quick conversation with the sales team can
establish whether or not it is useful to know the state or province of a
prospect. If call-backs are part of the sales process, then geography
could be key to timing a phone call. If emails are the primary means
of response, then knowing the location may be less relevant.
<br><br></p>

            <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
            <p><br>If you are reading this, you probably already a savvy marketer, so I
won't go too deeply into content. More of a reminder than anything, I'll
note that it is essential to focus on benefits and let prospects know
what is in store for them if they fill out a form, or click on a link. As
mentioned earlier, marketing automation technology has the ability to
monitor prospect actions and provide an experience that is response
driven. Automation actions can in turn channel increasingly targeted
material to prospects, or fast-track them in the sales process.
<br><br></p>
			
			<div class="break"><img src="images/testdot.png" alt="divider"><hr></div>

            <h2>Account Based Marketing (ABM), as an Approach, Not a Module</h2>
            <p><br>Another critical point of alignment between marketing and sales
involves understanding which companies should be accorded special
treatment. Although sales representatives have always practiced
account based marketing on an individual basis, the concept has
been scaled up the past few years and interfaced with technology to
give it extra muscle. For those not familiar with the term, account
based marketing is essentially the practice of identifying a select
group of companies, or people, who you want to sell to, and tailoring
your marketing materials accordingly. Marketing automation's ability
to customize assets with variable data can be highly useful here as
names, images and text can be formulated to speak directly to key prospects.<br><br>
Having a solid ABM program in place is also a great way to align with
your sales department and demonstrate that you are putting your
marketing team's energies behind the accounts that they believe will
have the greatest payoff. Although a number of marketing automation
platforms have developed ABM modules to facilitate this business
model, the majority of the higher-end solutions can be configured to
meet ABM program requirements. An experienced consultant who is
versed on the workings of the popular platforms should be able to
advise on which ones lend themselves to ABM initiatives.

            <h2>Putting Your Marketing Automation Plan in Motion</h2>
            <p><br>After you've considered the benefits of marketing automation, and
have achieved alignment with your sales team, it's time to make the
plan a reality. If you have a platform already in place, then perhaps it
is time to push the limits and see how it can be further leveraged. If
you are new to marketing automation, then you may want to enlist the
help of a marketing automation consultant to review your objectives
and determine which platform would best speak to your company's
requirements.<br><br>
As you have probably gathered, there is a lot of ground to cover when
developing a marketing automation program. The rewards, however,
are worthwhile as such initiatives provide compelling prospect
experiences, while simultaneously freeing up your time to craft even
more effective campaigns. To reduce learning curves and expedite
campaigns it can be helpful to partner with an experienced marketing
automation professional. In my upcoming blog post, I will review how
to formulate a comprehensive RFP when seeking a qualified
marketing automation consultant.
