s incredible to think that that we&rsquo;
ve been manufacturing cellulosic products for 100 plus years and producing Clarifoil&reg;
film as an alternative to petroleum-based plastics for more than 70 yeas. These products are commercially proven across a wide variety of applications and markets.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Today,
Celanese sells our Clarifoil&reg;
Cellulosic Film&mdash;
basically wood pulp and vinegar&mdash;
to some of the most recognizable brands around the world.</span></p><div><span style="font-size: 20px;">Now we're introducing our BlueRidge&reg; Cellulosic Pellets that will bring the same sustainability benefits and performance attributes to rigid plastic containers.</span></div>
